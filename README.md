## 📌 Overview
The **Traffic Management System** is a C++ application designed to **regulate and optimize traffic flow** in urban areas. It includes **vehicle detection, traffic signal control, congestion monitoring, and emergency handling**.

## 🚀 Features
- 🚘 **Vehicle Detection**: Monitors vehicles entering and exiting intersections.
- 🚦 **Traffic Signal Control**: Adjusts signal timing dynamically based on congestion.
- 📊 **Real-time Traffic Analysis**: Calculates congestion levels and recommends alternate routes.
- 🚑 **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Allows emergency vehicles to bypass traffic.
- 📈 **Data Logging & Reporting**: Records traffic data for future analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** (Core logic and simulation)
- **OOP Concepts** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- **File Handling** (For data storage and retrieval)
- **DSA** (Queues for traffic flow, Graphs for route optimization)

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TrafficManagementSystem.git
   cd TrafficManagementSystem
  ```
```
2.Compile & Run
```sh
g++ main.cpp -o traffic_system
./traffic_system
```
🎯 How It Works
Traffic Flow Simulation: Monitors vehicle movement and manages signals accordingly.

Emergency Handling: Prioritizes emergency vehicles to pass without delays.

Data Logging: Stores traffic data for optimization insights.
